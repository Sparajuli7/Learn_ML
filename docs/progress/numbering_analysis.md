    - **Problems:**
      - Missing files 94-98

## Summary of Issues

### Critical Problems:
1. **Numbering Conflicts**: Multiple files with same numbers across directories
2. **Missing Files**: Many files referenced in index.md don't exist
3. **Wrong Numbering**: Files numbered outside their expected ranges
4. **Incomplete Sections**: Some sections have very few files

### Files with Numbering Conflicts:
- File 12: core_ml_fields/12_bayesian_ml.md vs specialized_ml/12_time_series_forecasting.md
- File 13: core_ml_fields/13_recommender_systems.md vs specialized_ml/13_graph_ml.md
- File 14: core_ml_fields/14_anomaly_detection.md vs specialized_ml/14_speech_audio_processing.md
- File 21: ml_engineering/21_data_engineering.md vs specialized_ml/21_ai_reasoning.md
- File 22: ml_engineering/22_ml_infrastructure.md vs specialized_ml/22_diffusion_models.md
- File 23: ml_engineering/23_model_deployment.md vs specialized_ml/23_generative_audio_video.md
- File 32: tools_and_ides/32_cursor_ide_expert.md vs ai_security/32_ai_security_fundamentals.md
- File 50: advanced_topics/50_federated_learning.md vs llms_and_ai_models/50_small_language_models/
- File 51: advanced_topics/51_ai_ethics_safety.md vs llms_and_ai_models/51_frontier_models/
- File 52: advanced_topics/52_quantum_machine_learning.md vs infrastructure/52_hardware_for_ai.md
- File 53: advanced_topics/53_neurosymbolic_ai.md vs infrastructure/53_cloud_computing_ml.md
- File 54: advanced_topics/54_causal_ai.md vs infrastructure/54_edge_ai.md
- File 55: advanced_topics/55_ai_safety_alignment.md vs infrastructure/55_scalable_systems_design.md

## Recommended Fix Strategy

1. **Re-number all files** to follow the index.md structure
2. **Create missing files** for gaps in numbering
3. **Resolve conflicts** by giving unique numbers to all files
4. **Update index.md** to reflect actual file structure
5. **Ensure consistency** between directory structure and file numbering
