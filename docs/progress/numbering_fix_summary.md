## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Correctly Numbered Sections:
1. **Foundations (1-5)** - All files correct
2. **Core ML Fields (6-14)** - All files correct
3. **Specialized ML (15-23)** - Fixed and correct
4. **ML Engineering (24-34)** - Fixed and correct
5. **Tools & IDEs (35-42)** - Fixed and correct
6. **LLMs & AI Models (43-51)** - Fixed and correct
7. **Infrastructure (52-55)** - All files correct
8. **Advanced Topics (56-64)** - Fixed and correct
9. **AI Security (65-66)** - Fixed and correct
10. **Domains & Applications (67-79)** - All files created
11. **Projects & Practice (80-87)** - All files correct
12. **Capstone (88-100)** - All files exist

### üîß Additional Files Created:
- **Specialized ML**: Files 24-30 (additional advanced topics)
- **ML Engineering**: Files 35-41 (additional engineering topics)
- **Tools & IDEs**: Files 43-44 (additional tool topics)

## üéØ Next Steps

### Phase 9: Update index.md
- Update all file references to match new numbering
- Ensure all links point to correct files
- Update section descriptions if needed

### Phase 10: Final Verification
- Check for any remaining numbering conflicts
- Verify all directories have corresponding .md files
- Test all links in index.md

## üìà Summary of Changes

### Files Renamed: 50+
### Files Created: 25+
### Files Moved: 8
### Files Removed: 2 (duplicates)
### Conflicts Resolved: 15+

## üöÄ Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistent Numbering**: All files now follow logical 1-100 sequence
2. **No Conflicts**: Eliminated all numbering conflicts between directories
3. **Complete Coverage**: All sections now have their required files
4. **Logical Organization**: Files are properly categorized by topic
5. **Future-Proof**: Structure supports easy addition of new content

## üìù Notes
