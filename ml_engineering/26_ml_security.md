## ðŸŽ¯ Introduction

ML security is like building a fortress for your AI - you need multiple layers of protection to defend against sophisticated attacks while ensuring your AI systems remain trustworthy and reliable. In 2025, with AI systems becoming increasingly critical to business operations, security is not just important; it's essential for survival.

### Why ML Security Matters in 2025

The AI landscape in 2025 demands security systems that can handle:
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Sophisticated attacks designed to fool AI systems
- **Data Privacy**: Protecting sensitive training and inference data
- **Model Theft**: Preventing unauthorized access to valuable AI models
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements (GDPR, AI Act, CCPA)
- **Trust**: Ensuring AI systems remain reliable and trustworthy
- **Business Continuity**: Protecting AI systems from disruption

### The Security Evolution

ML security has evolved dramatically:

- **2010s**: Basic model protection with simple encryption
- **2015s**: Adversarial training and basic defenses
- **2020s**: Comprehensive security frameworks and privacy-preserving ML
- **2025**: AI-native security with automated threat detection

## ðŸ§® Mathematical Foundations

### Security Metrics

#### 1. Attack Success Rate (ASR)
```
ASR = (Successful attacks) / (Total attacks) Ã— 100
```

#### 2. Model Robustness Score (MRS)
```
MRS = 1 - (ASR / 100)
```

#### 3. Privacy Loss (PL)
```
PL = Information_leaked / Total_information
```

#### 4. Security Coverage (SC)
```
SC = (Protected_components) / (Total_components) Ã— 100
```

### Example Calculation

For a model with 1000 attack attempts:
- Successful attacks: 50
- Protected components: 95%
- Privacy loss: 2%

```
ASR = (50 / 1000) Ã— 100 = 5%
MRS = 1 - (5 / 100) = 0.95
SC = 95%
PL = 2%
```

## ðŸ’» Implementation

### 1. Adversarial Training with Adversarial Robustness Toolbox

The Adversarial Robustness Toolbox is like a security training ground for your AI - it helps you identify vulnerabilities and build defenses against attacks.

### 2. Privacy-Preserving ML with Differential Privacy

Differential privacy is like adding noise to protect individual privacy while maintaining model accuracy - it ensures that no single data point can be identified from the model's output.

# Why: Protect individual privacy in ML models
# How: Apply differential privacy techniques
# Where: Privacy-sensitive ML applications
